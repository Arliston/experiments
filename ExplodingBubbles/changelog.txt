About: Gravity Bubbles redone ... and more explosive

v20221218a:
    + Added dark theme (toggleable by pressing "D")
    + Added ill flares
        > Produced by bees harvesting an ill bubble (or the death of an ill bee)
        > Can spread illness to other bubbles and hives
    * Tweaks to bee behavior
    * Lightning now bursts bubbles
    * When a bubble is hit by a killer flare, any modern debris within the bubble gains mass
v20221207a:
    + Added lightning
        > Randomly strikes modern debris and armored hives when raining
        > Larger modern debris chunks split when struck by lightning
        > Currently no effect on armored hives (yet)
    + Added new keybinds for spawning
        > "H" for hive
        > "K" for killer flare
        > "Q" for modern debris
        > "X" for lightning (only visual; effects caused only by natural lightning)
    + Added pausing and speed controls
        > "[" to halve speed
        > "]" to double speed
        > Space to pause/resume
        > Rain toggle now "R" instead of space
    * Modern debris now fully immune to killer flares
    * Hives' armor no longer degrades when hit with a killer flare
        > Protection from killer flares now a random chance per hit depending on amount of armor
v20201214a:
    + Added modern debris
        > When a killer flare strikes a bubble, there is a 1% chance of spawning a chunk of modern debris
        > Chunks of modern debris move erratically, may split and merge, and can bounce flares
        > Bees may collect modern debris to armor their hives
        > Modern debris and armored hives are resistant to killer flares, though they degrade with each hit
        > Modern debris released when an armored hive dies
v20190124a:
    + Added hives and bees
    * When a bubble gets large enough to explode, there is now a 20% chance of dropping a hive with half its mass instead of exploding
        > Hives randomly spawn bees
        > Bees target bubbles to collect mass for the hives, sent as flares
        > Hives slowly lose mass over time
        > Hives die once their mass gets too low
        > When a hive gets massive enough, it may spawn a new hive with half its mass
        > When a raindrop flare hits a hive, there is a 30% chance of it becoming ill
        > Ill hives spawn ill bees
        > Ill bees infect bubbles with illness
        > Ill bubbles explode into killer flares
        > Ill hives massive enough to spawn a new hive instead explode into killer flares
    * Pressing space now toggles rain
    - Killer flares no longer randomly spawn by themselves
