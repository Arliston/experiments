About: Gravity Bubbles redone ... and more explosive

v20201214a:
    + Added modern debris
        > When a killer flare strikes a bubble, there is a 1% chance of spawning a chunk of modern debris
        > Chunks of modern debris move erratically, may split and merge, and can bounce flares
        > Bees may collect modern debris to armor their hives
        > Modern debris and armored hives are resistant to killer flares, though they degrade with each hit
        > Modern debris released when an armored hive dies
v20190124a:
    + Added hives and bees
    * When a bubble gets large enough to explode, there is now a 20% chance of dropping a hive with half its mass instead of exploding
        > Hives randomly spawn bees
        > Bees target bubbles to collect mass for the hives, sent as flares
        > Hives slowly lose mass over time
        > Hives die once their mass gets too low
        > When a hive gets massive enough, it may spawn a new hive with half its mass
        > When a raindrop flare hits a hive, there is a 30% chance of it becoming ill
        > Ill hives spawn ill bees
        > Ill bees infect bubbles with illness
        > Ill bubbles explode into killer flares
        > Ill hives massive enough to spawn a new hive instead explode into killer flares
    * Pressing space now toggles rain
    - Killer flares no longer randomly spawn by themselves
